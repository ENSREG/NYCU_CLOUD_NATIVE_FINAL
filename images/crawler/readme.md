# Directory explaination
- ./data
    1. GroundTruth.csv: the real data which is produced by crawler
    2. Pred.csv: the data which is generated by model
- ./ckpt
    1. BayesianRidge.pkl: the model we use
    
- ./header: our code about model and crawler

# How to use?

## Run
```bash=
python3 run.py
# then we will store GroundTruth.csv, Pred.csv in ./data
```

## Test
1. test crawler
```bash=
python3 test_crawler.py
```

2. test model
```bash=
python3 test_model.py
```
