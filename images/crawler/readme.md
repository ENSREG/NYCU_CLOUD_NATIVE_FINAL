# Directory explaination
- ./data
    1. GroundTruth.csv: the real data which is produced by crawler
    2. Pred.csv: the data which is generated by model
- ./ckpt
    1. BayesianRidge.pkl: the model we use
    
- ./header: our code about model and crawler

# How to use?

## Run
```bash=
python3 run.py
# then we will store GroundTruth.csv, Pred.csv in ./data
```

# header explaination

## crawler 
```python=
from header.crawler import GoogleCrawler

"""
You can see the using example in main_crawler.py
	python3 main_crawler.py
"""

```

## model 
```python=
from header.model import feature_generation, predict, get_csv_from_json
from header.model.evaluate import regression_report

"""
You can see the using example in ../main_model.ipynb
"""
